# Tic Tac Toe

This is a project part of The Odin Project's curriculum.


## Introduction

In this project i will apply the knowledge from previous lessons of The Odin Project's curriculum:

* [Objects and Object Constructors](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/objects-and-object-constructors)
* [Factory Functions and the Module Pattern](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/factory-functions-and-the-module-pattern)

This project will serve as practice to further understand the workflow with objects, IIFE's and some basic design patterns like: 

* The object literal(a.k.a. Module pattern) 
* The pub-sub pattern.


## Rules of the game

Tic tac toe is a game usually played on paper by 2 players, each player have to select a symbol to play with. 
There's only 2 symbols; X's and O's.
The game is played in a grid of 3 x 3, each cell represents one play that each player can do.

To start the game, the first player must draw the chosen symbol on the cell they want to play, then the next player has to select a cell to play.
To win the game one player has to successfully align 3 symbols whether it be on a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line.
If no player wins, the match should be replayed until one player can win. The game can be played as many times as the players wish.
